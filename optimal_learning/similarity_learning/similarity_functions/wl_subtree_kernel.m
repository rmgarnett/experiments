% function kernel_matrix = wl_subtree_kernel(data, responses, graph_ind, h)
%
% inputs:
%        data: an (n x n) matrix where n is the total number of
%              nodes appearing in all graphs.  data should be a
%              block-diagonal matrix where the ith block
%              corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the ith
%              graph.  the graph_ind argument, below, provides an
%              index into data for conveniently extracting the
%              adjacency matrix for a specified graph.
%   responses: an (n x 1) vector containing the node labels of the
%              nodes appearing in all graphs.  node labels are
%              expected to be integers from 1..[num_classes]. the
%              entries in responses align with the rows of data, and
%              the graph_ind argument, below, can also be used to
%              index into responses to extract the node labels for a
%              specified graph.
%   graph_ind: an (n x 1) vector indicating which graph each row
%              (node) appearing in data/responses corresponds to.
%              the graphs are expected to be numbered with the
%              integers 1..[num_graphs].
%           h: an integer corresponding to the desired h parameter
%              as defined in the paper above.  if K_i represents
%              the kernel on the feature vectors resulting from the
%              ith application of the wl-subtree transformation,
%              then we return
%
%                 K_1(G, G) + K_2(G, G) + ... + K_h(G, G).
%
% outputs:
%   kernel_matrix: the resulting kernel matrix between the graphs.
